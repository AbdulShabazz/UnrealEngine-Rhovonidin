# Backstory

Play as Lance Rhovonidin! Join The Remnant and wade into the disputed territories, toward the Walled Metropolis to retake the crown from General Agrippa and crush the Shard rebellion.

Lance's parents are the founders of KaiZen warfare: Lance's mother pioneered Zen fighting, which focuses only on lethal and effective movement; and his father developed the art of 1-hit kill, theoretically allowing a soldier to vanquish an unlimited number of opponents.

## IDE / SDK - Unreal Engine
- [ ] Compile 8c optimized PE
- [ ] Add grid snap to nodes
- [ ] Allow swap unencumbered crossed wires
- [ ] Disable bright colored wires [ Engine > Source > Editor Graph Editor > Private > ConnectionDrawingPolicy.cpp:512 ]

## Notes  
- [ ] Context aware animations which factor-in player sentiment, locale, position, awareness team Al., for smoother and more cinematic interactions during action sequences involving NPCs and props.  
- [ ] Render animations at the bone matrix level to train A.I. on correct positional vectors for rendering movement from any angle  
- [ ] Arena-style platformer  
- [ ] Add an attack silhouette to aid the player with timing their counter-attacks, and not resorting to button smashing.  
- [ ] As Agrippa sheds his armor, during combat, he trades lethal 1-hit winning combos for speed. His most deadly combos occurring in the middle of his full armorment set.  
- [ ] Agrippa can hurl his cave-axe to cause cave-ins as he pins Lance to the regolith  
- [ ] The Dreadded are sentinel swarms that act cooperatively to find and target Lance  
- [ ] Include (Omniscient) Replay to allow the player to witness how the real events unfolded  
- [ ] GIGA Corps sponsors Federation apparel  
- [ ] Electrical Energy from the UltraDam is stored in underground mines and mineshafts in a roller-coaster elevator network system of ore-filled cauldrons capable of running for 72h  
- [ ] Lt Sheeran has Darth Vader-like abilities  
- [ ] Import cast (characters) cast into unreal
- [ ] If Lance mis times an initial attack but the follow up is timed perfectly, his character recovers his initiative (eg weapon drop which damages opponent onlyvto be recovered to inflict further damage) to inflict deep the damage
- [ ] Pressing the Xi button near enemies gives Rhovonidin preemptive abilities
- [ ] Enable skip cinematics
- [ ] Enable skip subplots and side-quests (eg. Sheeran), for speedruns; however player misses the opportunity to level-up
- [ ] Seperate animations by stride for smoother frame LERP; or segment continuous frame sequence using sync markers
- [ ] Develop (gameplay engine) in C++ then expose to Blueprints
- [ ] Chain animation sequences for smoother transitions
- [ ] Telegraph battle cutscene entry points with emissive textures for gestures, weapons, and props, so Lance remains focused on the Xi meter
- [ ] Game sounds play at full volume upon first encounters (eg Fields of Grass > country road)
- [ ] Allow idle recuperation
- [ ] Wardrobes grant Lance special abilities
- [ ] Enable wardrobe (enrobe) animations and sounds SFX
- [ ] Player chooses spawn terrain
- [ ] New animations unlocked by the player are awarded as unlocks in their inventory, with tutorials, for later reference. Tutorials are available during the game for context sensitive training.
- [ ] Terrains have their own themes
- [ ] Incorporate cavalry summoner flag poles (on timer countdown), which can activate, summon, and or be disabled (by adversary players)
- [ ] A player's victory (growl) induces showkwaves which inflict further damage, if adversary fails to retreat in awe
- [ ] Lance can replay prior maps to unlock all fight animations ( for online play )
- [ ] JUMP, DODGE, CLIMB, SWIM, SLIDE (etc compulsory movement animations) are A.I. processed, without keybindings or player interaction
- [ ] Lance can set waypoints and free roam the entire maps
- [ ] Utilize filmic INSERTS and INTERCUTS for a cinematic experience
- [ ] Stealthy sentinels can initiate an attack from across the battle field
- [ ] Capture card integration to record gameplay (unlimited length)
- [ ] Player adjusts to camera facing when required for movement
- [ ] autosave cross-platform progress for (optional) cross platform play
- [ ] HUD and Health meters animate and level up, upon level startup
- [ ] Employ Style-ized gritty minimally acrobatic in game combat (ie Captain America: Winter Soldier, John Wick, 300 The Movie)
- [ ] Progressive gameplay is not required; players may reengage respawned enemies in any area of the map
- [ ] Employ opening cinematics, highlighting a region, its points of interest, its threats, as well as biome Fade In Titles (eg The UltraDam), as well as closing cinematics, upon exit
- [ ] Battle Motifs can overlap. All weapons are catchable tossable. Lance can summon battle motifs (see below)
- [ ] Dr. Meade employs remote viewers to invoke The Dulles Effect - A virtual world digital twin, instantiated software to test a target's tendencies and capabilities (ie predictive not prophetic)
- [ ] The game cannot be paused, idle zones are usedd, instead
- [ ] Tunable weather system [Auto|Custom|Static|Dynamic]
- [ ] All in game places, events, and locations named conspicuously -- in voice, text, and maps -- in order for the player to catalogue
- [ ] Design a strict computer algebra for use in the Euclid Prover
- [ ] Euclid verifies Screenplay- and Story, per page
- [ ] Include a keyword libary, for Euclid Prover to verify keywords (streamline anonym and synonym keyword libary)
- [ ] in game mistakes do not reset the game; in game mistakes scale up difficulty, allowing the player to continue, at a cost
- [ ] Ensure the most fun way to play the game is the best way to play the game
- [ ] Encourage under used play tactics (eg employing block breakers) rather than discouraging gameplay, (eg limited ammo) carrots vs sticks!
- [ ] Minimize the player cognitive load
- [ ] Swords, Shields, and other hand weapons are plentiful while Phasors, and ammo is rare
- [ ] As the Xi meter increases, A.I. aided tactics (in combat) increases (ie the avalanche effect); the Xi meter drops when lance spams the Xi meter or when Lance's timimg diverges from best tactics
- [ ] Archers only engage when Lance is exposed and they have a clear line of sight; they yell and shout commands to others in the theatre to warn one another
- [ ] Frontload best ideas into the opening of the game. The most important 15 minutes of gameplay is the first 15 minutes; the most important hour is the first hour, etc.
- [ ] The player's first impression of each experience sets the tone
- [ ] Meet the player's hgh bar of expected quality gameplay
- [ ] Refrain from placeholders in early-access releases: show only what you have in order to get accurate and useful feedback from beta testers 
- [ ] Employ baked animation, volumetrics and lighting for improved final render quality
- [ ] A full game is a short story, not a novel. There are not many fully developed theatrical beats
- [ ] Q: Is it possible to include baked lighting sequences into character animations and sync the two?
- [ ] Add multi monitor support for muliplayer (offline) gaming
- [ ] Allow game difficulty settings to be adjusted in game
- [ ] Add an inventory system
- [ ] Find a way to create PBR characterS & animations that rival PBR game environments in render quality (cf Assassin's Creed Valhallah (CUT SCENES))
- [ ] C++ STL Templates are performant. They remove virtual functions and other unused functions.
- [ ] Lambda functions are useful and fast when you know which functions will execute at compile time.
- [ ] Memory allocation is slow. Reuse objects (delete) instead of glibc free
- [ ] Allocations are costly. Use a pool of preallocated objects.
- [ ] Delete objects using a seperate thread
- [ ] Multiple threads sap resources
- [ ] Use automated tests to find edge cases
- [ ] Shorten BOSS battles under 2 mins (sic health meters), while tailoring missions towards conquest and exploration
- [ ] Use color value and contrast to highlight important objectives
- [ ] Use stunning backgrounds
- [ ] Seperate A.I. into discrete functional levels (Behavior > Functional > Pathfinding)
- [ ] Precompute and datalabel all objects in the arena so A.I. can prioritize (filter) them, based on need (eg. AI: { CurrentNeed:Cover }; Scrap_Metal_Door: { Cover: true, Concealment: true}, LandBridge: { SmallFF: true. Add new layers of functionality as needed
- [ ] Test NavMesh (FP Accuracy) as far away from the origin as the Player/NPC is allowed
- [ ] A.I. fuzziness employs tolerance (ranges) to reduce indecision/inconsistency (Note: you cant fix inconsistency with increased complexity, eg. Instead of A.I. deciding which should next attack the player, allow the player's game mechanic to decide)
- [ ] Document (semantic) intent (ie with a theorem prover!) to find hard to duplicate bugs
- [ ] Ensure skippable cut scene moments are still legible and audible to adequately progress the story (cf Elden Ring (CUT SCENES))
- [ ] Keep a pre viz motion capture shotlist. Use verbs for direction (eg. Faster, Louder, Further)
- [ ] To improve performance, allow A.I. to react to the environment (optimize inputs towards desired outcome), rather than plan or attempt to anticipate outcomes
- [ ] Use Orthographic Views (instead of Perspective) to detect render and animation flaws
- [ ] Gaas (Gaming as a service) - These systems are simple, scalable, extensible, secure, and stable
- [ ] Examples: BIOS (DELL), Boot Loader (GRUB), Kernel (LINUX)
- [ ] Incoporate a Site of Grace (idle zone) load location[s] to prevent deathloops or otherwise unrecoverable states of gameplay
- [ ] A suggestion of behavior is better than a complex model of such: Our brains assume the complexity is there (ie base AI complexity on past human behavior; train AI to  follow human behavior, making the player believe they're competing against another player: eg. that guy just ran me off the road!)
- [ ] AI should be controller-based (user-capable), if not simply for testing purposes
- [ ] Machine Tols addon (Blender) is useful workflow tool for merging vertices
- [ ] PLUGINS: Consider NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling 100+ fps), Unreal Engine TSR (Temporal Super Resolution 100+ fps), AMD FSR 2.0 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 90 fps, INTEL XeSS
- [ ] Set playable demo/prototype goals
- [ ] Drive towards a clear vision. Design around game pillars
- [ ] "Timebox" / deadline ambiguous or uncertain goals to avoid wasting time
- [ ] Avoid feature creep (waiting for experimental tools and features)
- [ ] Perform time and cost measurements
- [ ] Plain well written code is superior to compact or clever. Who else will want to maintain it?
- [ ] EXPERIMENTAL: All controller-based Actors / NPCs, and Dynamic elements are overlayed onto 3D 4K 8K (BAKED) pre-render environments and lighting animations for highest quality; achieved by recording multiple angle animations of what the controller-based Actor is allowed to do, with animation entry and exit reference points, syncing frames with the environment and then overlaying these animations onto the environment. The developor can then edit the animation rig to customize it for new characterS
- [ ] Actors sdded by foliage tools are not selectable
- [ ] Include any customized UE library file[s] in your workspace to ship with the completed game
- [ ] Patch any hacks, mods, or overpowered conditions, on Expert Difficulty, only; whereas performance bugfixes apply to all areas
- [ ] Crashes represent unhandled edge-cases
- [ ] Working with the UE streaming pool: reduce total number of visible textures; reduce resolution of visible textures; use Optimization View modes for debugging; Ensure textures are at a power of 2 resolution and are generating MIPs; Use Virtual textures; Increase streamin gpool size (device dependant)
- [ ] Modular AI: Good modules do not do much; smaller modules improve comprehension; Loosely coupled modules prevent failures; stateless engines are resilient (crashless)
- [ ] HP meter bar flashes when damage received is above 25%
- [ ] $2M of $3M budget s/b to attract star-power
- [ ] Fight combinations are unlocked as they are used for faster speedruns
- [ ] Animations: Consider choosing static messh over skeletal mesh for performance without loss in visual quality, similar to how foliage is animated
- [ ] Use mesh islands (within the mesh), rather then seperate combined meshes, especially for complex objects such as cars, weapons, machines etc
- [ ] Buildings and other connected regions can be constructed using ISM components (static mesh) to reduce Actor count
- [ ] Split buildings into upper- and lower sections with lower sections supporting complex and articulate collision, with the upper section supporting only simple collision
- [ ] Baking improves render performance at the cost of degrees of freedom
- [ ] JavaScript async/await is a powerful programming workflow we can try to export to Unreal
- [ ] Cap inventory and then incorporate context-sensitive pickups which generate story-narrative during gameplay
- [ ] Allow option to disable controller inputs
- [ ] Use 60-30-10 color system rule of cinematography
- [ ] Instead of caching feature data with each Actor, allow the Actor to inherit the feature from a static? global repository to reduce fragmenttation and improve performance
- [ ] Ray trace groups improve performance (eg unique ID per building). Sparse objects should be excluded from Ray Trace Groups; reduce overlapping actors and meshes -- keep the geometry clean; ray trace meshes close to the screen, while (boolean) merged distant geometry receives HLOD1, to facilitate Global Illumination (GI) over large distances (14km+)
- [ ] All UDIMs should use same-size tiles (eg 4K) (Easier to track)
- [ ] RealityCapture (iOS) can generate MegaScans
- [ ] UNREAL_ENGINE: IK Rig and IK Goals expose IK Rig to blueprints, so no-bake cutscenes are possible; reacting NPCs can have smoother character animations. Reduces total baked animations.
- [ ] Employ dynamic hit boxes which match up to snapshots in the current animation frame, for sublime Elden Ring calibre hitboxes
- [ ] Let player disable/enable NPC skills + abilities; A gameplay (configuration) hash is displayed onscreen during speedruns and walkthroughs
- [ ] Employ a Theorem Prover to reason over offscreen NPC events, rather than a continuous background monitoring process
- [ ] Include a radio station of soundtracks spanning multiple genres
- [ ] Create unique and unforgettable NPCs, areas, and missions -- no cut-n-paste effort!
- [ ] Encourage community NFTs, marketplace, and maps
- [ ] Quick, measured counter-attacks recover HP
- [ ] Challenge the player to access areas of the map through chaining their abilities
- [ ] Turning in the direction of wind allows you to hear the breeze
- [ ] Employ visually engaging close-up fight cinematics
- [ ] (High Velocity) Projectile weapons emit tracers which can be tracked by the eye (especially paused game states)
- [ ] Holding the "Action" button with proper placement and gameplay constraints allows Lance to execute properly timed [counter-]attacks; the button must be depressed and held to properly reposition Lance. In this way, Lance can fully interact with other NPCs and the environment to his advantage
- [ ] Against Agrippa, player's must have solid stance and fight combinations, because Agrippa will seek out and expose deficiencies
- [ ] Color code interactive in-game elements
- [ ] Create symmetric IK Rigs animations that can be replayed on any plane of symmetry
- [ ] Document NPC-, flora- and fauna-, etc (via inventory) for Lance to learn to his advantage
- [ ] Include timestamps in game walkthroughs
- [ ] RECOMMENDED: mild opposition, treasures, or trinkets (every 45s) during gameplay; Underboss opposition every 5m; stage-boss opposition every 15m

- [ ] Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order @13:08:00 Story Design
- [ ] Provide automatic reaction-style (Action Button, AI Governed) which disengage only when the player is hit or blocked,
and manual reaction-style (combination, button-smashing) combat options
- [ ] Lance can snatch any NPCs weapon, however those are not as durable as the weapons he purchases or even discovers
- [ ] Lance's weapon is durable enough, with proper timing he can deflect high calibre semi-automatic
rounds (0.250ms reflexes);
otherwise, he must duck dodge or block; fully automatic barrages are much too dense to deflect in any effective manner
- [ ] Lt Sheeran can re-deflect 1 deflected round; Lance has unlimited round deflect capability
- [ ] Lance can discover body armor
- [ ] Armored arm-, shin-, and leg- guards can deflect high calibre rounds
- [ ] Multiple camera renders (even disabled) can impact fps
- [ ] Reflections can impact fps; collect reflectable elements into their own layer (performance)
- [ ] Use a low-poly mesh object in game environments. A high poly mesh material, baked into a normal map can then be used over the low poly mesh object (performance)
- [ ] Use memoization with constexpr instead of either, to remove the constexpr compile time computation limit; and for overall improved compile times
- [ ] Use occlusion & culling settings to reduce unneeded draw calls for occluded objects
- [ ] Use baked lights, light maps, lighting layers (swappable), cached light probes (for prebake) on static content

- [ ] Sound, Visuals acn be used to layer, densely reinforce information
- [ ] Use the Combat Square to develop methods to perfect target these squares immediately, or at some delay into the future
- [ ] Dull or unessential areas will be avoided by the player upon their next walkthrough, and thus should not be considered content- [ ] Publish all Pawn/NPC movesets for Lance to study
- [ ] provide rewards / treasure chests items of value to a player based upon their style of gameplay (eg spell power -ups vs armor or weapons ) ; perhaps make them constituents instead with various uses for weapons armor or spells; or have chests deliver multiple items
- [ ] disolay the location of these on the player's map
- [ ] place treasure and rewards in context-appropriate locations which define their use or how and when it should be used
- [ ] summoned NPCs or other NPC cooperatives can loot the pickup items for Lance . f1 Allow multi boss encounters
- [ ] Let a boss's damage delivery be related to their combat effectiveness as opposed to an overpowering weapon, unless deemed context appropriate
- [ ] Agrippa can deliver damage to hot zones on the ground which become radioactive (le fatal) after a few moments 1ff standing in them
- [ ] A pawn can send an attack to any active grid in his battle grid (see above) within the following durations (seconds) : [-30, -15, -10, -8,-4, -2,-1, feigned, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 30]s
- [ ] Even during long NPC movesets Lance can always inflict damage iff skilled; there are no unblockable movesets
- [ ] Allow Lance and other PCs smooth skip or abort combat animatlons aid combat for improved gameplay and anticipating PCs
- [ ] To Lance, striking him to the ground, "where are you from, Grifter?", Shinoba
- [ ] Lance must escape from a trick-knot- [ ] People enjoy the emotional expression games give, through gameplay. Focus on giving individual emotional expression to players
- [ ] Specially placed NPCs/Actors have concurrent embedded story goals, which you can participate (eg a drug smuggler's goal to use the ongoing conflict to build his Everlast empire; construct a vacation home; bulld a beach shelter ) and progress it to Its completion or free-roam the entire map in a way that interests you
- [ ] Apply experimental textures to all primary shapes (circle, sphere, plane, square, etc) to quickly find artifacts and other rendering issues

- [ ] Chilean National Parks (REFERENCE) Geography
- [ ] Lance uses glue-techniques (eg block, duck, dash, shove) until experienced enough to level-up (technique gained through gameplay hours); situational combat is the way he unlocks experience
- [ ] Once leveled-up, Lance must perfect his attack timing for optimal situational combat results
- [ ] Update game content via download, as the player progresses and or new patches or DLC become available
- [ ] Use Vibration + Visual + Audio feedback to indicate combo completion
- [ ] "Parallel Random Number Generation, as Easy as 1-2-3", John K Salmon (REFERENCE)
- [ ] "A Very Fast Parallel Random Permutation Algorithm®, Axel Bacher (REFERENCE)
- [ ] The Action (Combat) Toggle (le Threat Presence Meter), and when to employ it, is used to drive the story, however the choice and its outcomes are left up to the player (eg. the Active Threat meter for Dr. Meade)
- [ ] Perhaps add an accessible content pane or drawer to the bottom of the screen, instead of an Inventory Menu or Pause Screen
- [ ] Lance has a shield to deflect phasor rounds, or perhaps an EMP mid story disables these weapons in certain areas of the map
- [ ] Characters remove their headgear for cutscenes and other drama-based actions
- [ ] Lance equips appropriate items from his environment, in lieu of a designated inventory assignment
- [ ] There are no combat-defense keybindings in the game, which allow Lance to defend himself: Even well-timed offensive manuevers would cause Lance to receive damage, resulting in a race of the last to hit bottom. Thus It was decided this style of play would be detrimental to overall gameplay, and thus Lance was given 99% perfect idle defensel,
- [ ] Allow Lance to focus on well-timed attacks (XI meter) while only being punished for poor timing.
- [ ] Automatic Combat Mode ( Toggle/Situational )
- [ ] OTOY Octane Render - Meshlets SSD Streaming (le its Nanite for Octane GPU Rendering)
- [ ] SOUND SYNTHESIS TOOLS: Most sound waves display periodic harmonic constituents across its spectrum, which can be replicated using software. The correct space-time placement of these pectral components Is a keystone for life-like reproduction.

# BOSS.h
## The Arena Battles &amp; Scheduler ( BOSS )
The "Battle OS# Is an Operating System and Scheduler, written In C++/Rust, as a compact Neural Network to process and schedule battle animation sequence messages . Animations are pulled from the
#Global_Anim_Sequence_Skel# - an extended animation sequence library containing «sync markers# (sm) to denote possibe animation entry/exit points and contact points for damage

During gameplay, characters may group, and, once a distance criteria is met, the Battles/Scheduler (BOSS) will initiate a Battle Sequence Scope Cut-scene (BSSC), managed in the software as a Blueprints Battle Sequence object ( #BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ]# ) . The Battle Sequence object #is the Neural Network used to process messages for the Global_Anim_Sequence_Skel
max_groups = Math.cell( Players [N]/2 )
min_groups = 1 // ( large )
Further discussion involving Lance, also applies to all online players
In general, Lance has no ability to govern the start of a sequence, and has no knowledge of the bounds of the battle scope, and thus should be ready to engage at all times
Once Lance enters a BSSC, he has the opportunity to Respond to any #Challenges#, as he proceeds, until he is out of scope
Characters engaged in a BSSC are grouped within the BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ] object
New event listeners are registered and attached to their game objects
Any resident-in-memory listeners are disabled, however they are not removed, for performance reasons If Lance's server session lags or times-out, the listener is disabled, and his character will take damage.
If Lance quits dies or teleports the listener is deleted from his game object, and he is removed from the BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ] and subsequently the BSSC .
Lance can be a member of multiple 8SSCs within the BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ] object
At the initiation of a battle animation sequence ( the #Challenge#| ), the BP _Battle_SEQ- [ ] A. I. initiates a well-timed response from Lance ( the Responsel )
Lance will only see Challenges that he can accept
Battle Animations are not interruptible
Battle OS functionality and Scheduling is verified in #Z3 Provers ( Python ) and or #Euclid Automated
Theoren Prover#
Following a challenge, there are six ( 6 ) levels (le acceptable states) of damage Lance can deliver and or accept
# *IK InstantKill** 100%
* *HP2. Highpower2** 75%
* *HP Highpower** 68%
* *MP2 Midpower2** 58%
* *MP Midpower** 30%
* *LP2 Lowpower2** 15%
* *LP Lowpower** Miss!

The above, now restated as a State Machine damage queue (SM) within the BOSS BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ]

The damage levels are derived by the BOSS, according to the *skill* level that Lance possesses (ie. his player direction, velocity, acceleration, and momentum;
his location on an opponent's player grid on the map; the current environment map; his weapons and equipment)
Once a *Challenge* is generated via distance criteria, the BOSS initializes a new SM, in the BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ], to process Responses for that group
Once another player enters the group, the BOSS adds the player to the SM, in the BP _Battle_SEQ- [ ], to process Responses for him in the group
A *Challenge* also is made evident to Lance because the player bodice will briefly *Shimmer* 
If Lance outranks the Challenger, Lance can allow the AI to process the response; however, when the rankings are reversed --
Lance will nned to intercede, for an attempt to generate a proper response, while also affording him the opportunity to increase ranking.
Poorly, timed responses will not adversely effect ranking, however it does theoretically allow the Responder to accept higher levels of damage
All rankings are managed internally and are not available for inspection to the player. However the player will receive visible indicators,
such as lesser levels of damage inflicted, while greater levels of damage is taken, along with either player displaying a better stance or superior technique
A state-machine is used, rather than a message queue so the queue cannot be spammed. In the queue, if a new sequence's current frame has a time code less or equal to the current tick, the new sequence is allowed to be swapped in and the animation frame pointer is reset; otherwise, the next frame in the current sequence is displayed.

## The MSG Packet Instruction word
The BOSS uses MSG packets to coordinate and or initialize SMs in the BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ]
Each MSG packet is a static-width packet, composed of an *Instruction Word*, which transmits the group ( G ) Lance belongs, and his player index (N)
## The MSG Packet: Issuing The Challenge
As mentioned, a new SM is instantiated in the BOSS's BP_Battle_SEQ- [ ] (The Challengel) to process Response [ R ] messages for that group
The MSG packet's group field ( G ) shall serve as the SM address which accepts all Responses for the group . If it does not yet exist, it is created
Among other things, the player's skill level is used to calculate levels of damage
The SM is now ready to process Responses
#### The MSG Packet: Processing The Response
The state machine (SM) will process Response MSGs for the group in its current state, until the next-state delay is reached
Assuming Lance's *Response* is within the accepted time delay, De, the MSG packet's group field ( G ) will enter the SM at state De. Thus, Lance's player index ( N) is OR'd with other players within the Player field, for eventual event-dispatch, by the BOSS, into the qualifying animation sequence

### Gameplay: Assigning Players to group [s]
Assigning Lance to a group is another role of the BOSS.
Lance's equipment and or his weapons cache determine his effective range, and thus the bounded range of the group. Each of his weapons and equipment is encompassed by a bounding n-gon, which the BOSS uses to determine as an optimal tactic ( le a next battle animation ) for Lance, based on the skill of everyone in the group!

### Notes
- [ ] Story beats are fixed as waypoints; how the player arrives at each is determined by their choices
- [ ] Games are replayable based on the moment-to-moment actions that the player enjoys.
- [ ] Add double-dash custom settings for far map traversal.
- [ ] Build an API driven IDE SDK which instantiates necessary classes, properties, library imports, parameter list completions, and function calls as standard overhead.
- [ ] Use Perlin Noise to generate Height/Displacement/Bump Maps that can be inspected before approval, instead of random level generation ( le No State of Gameplay Should Ever be Unknown to The Developer ) 
- [ ] Supporting Actor's are brought back to support Rhovonidin
- [ ] Construct an obstacle course to verify character agility 
- [ ] Remote Viewers analyze behavior to build digital profiles for use as potential military targets

## THE PLAYTESTING ENGINE & REGIME
- [ ] Game states are hashed to indicate unique states of gameplay
- [ ] Each playtest should reveal meaningful actionable information for each department
- [ ] Gameplay should remain fun (Gameplay frictions are successfully minimized), consisting of Unguided Playthroughs and Usability Tests
- [ ] External playtesting 1s most effective & common
### UNGUIDED PLAYTHROUGHS
- [ ] Find the pain points of: Pacing, Narrative, Difficulty Management, Economy and Progression Tuning
- [ ] Post Mortem: Watch speed runs online to analyze the way games are broken
### USABILITY TESTING
- [ ] Deep Dive insures: Usability of in-game features and components, Isolates in-gane issues,
- [ ] Use Telemetry to create, update, and patch more accurate profiles and game settings
# Unreal Engine
- [ 1 ] Use blueprints optimizations
- [ 2 ] Use breakpoints. They are builtin to blueprints! They can help verify game flow.
- [ 3 ] Use/Enable Data Layers. Assign Actors to Data Layers instead of the global Outliner. Data Layers are useful for large open worlds. Toggle Data Layers to prototype, test ideas, and isolate gase play bugs at the game play level.
- [ 4 ] Valley of The Ancients Demo for Unreal Engine 5 has and uses lots of industry best-practices.
- [ 5 ] Proper techniques in all aspects - It is the characteristic that exemplifles the life of a champion.
- [ 6 ] 4K HDR Game file (~100 GB)
- [ 7 ] given: toggle|true|false - - which implementation produces the lowest chance of semantic error.

### Render Performance Tips
- [ 8 ] - Flatten multiple textures Into a single image texture, resulting in a single draw 
- [ 9 ] - Break animation sequences into modular animation sequences [ ]ump, Crawl, Wink, etc.) for easier bake into keyframe animation sequence . Or use batched draw calls (UES), or Merge Actors . Or use Character AI and the screen recorder (in blender)

Notes
Each sparse well-timed button-press triggers a battle sequence; spamming buttons is ineffective. No hints or meters are shown. Instinct is properly developed.
