## Notes

Maps without **dynamic lighting** or **particle effects** appear mundane. Incorporating consistent and **dynamic decals** (eg. HUD: Maps, Waypoints, Weapons and Inventory), **particle animations** (eg. Lighted loot box interiors; Souls evaporating from felled enemies; Dynamic levers and switches; Character and NPC adornments), and **ambient lighted environments** -- add to the allure of an evironment map.
