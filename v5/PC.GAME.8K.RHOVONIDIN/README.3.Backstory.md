- [ ] The temperate biomes undergo seasonal changes.
- [ ] Lt. Sheeran wields electricity which grows in intensity, freneticism, and inflicted damage, with prolongued use and success.
- [ ] All (player) attacks consumes HP; successful combinations + idle rest, restore HP
- [ ] Dialogue interaction cards are stored for the player to revisit
- [ ] Use Boss Battle Ring Teleports (i.e., floor decals) for better separation of levels and easier debugging.
- [ ] Add a mic option to the screen recording option to support player livestreams and or walkthroughs.
- [ ] Lt. Sheeran's Kinetic Rage electricity moveset releases a short range EMP which disables nearby Rebel tech.
- [ ] When (Lance) armed with the bow & arrow, he cannot block, only adeptly dodge (e.g., roll), or parry.
- [ ] Use the Unreal Engine Take Recorder to cache blend-space animations as animation montages which support anim-notifies and other gameplay tags. Note: anim-notifies in tandem with gameplay tags can be used to construct exquisite (Elden-Ring quality) Hit Boxes.
- [ ] During gameplay, the player camera culls occluding, non-perimeter-bounding structures which hinder the user's ability to control Lance.
- [ ] Use AI to make the Situational Combat (SC) between Lance and NPCs more smooth and elegant
- [ ] Rather than employ Gameplay Diffficulty selection screens, integrate the difficulty into the choice or absence of armor and or weapons the player chooses from their inventory (e.g,. EMPs and bunker busters which deploy widespread damage yet draw heavy swarms of enemies; and the choice of battling naked, wearing body oils, or going with no armor, which increases speed but also damage taken as well as lowers stealth)
- [ ] Rather than arbitrary insignificant skirmishes in which Lance overpowers NPCs, make each engagement meaningful: Give NPCs significant HP, demonstrating strategy and skill for Lance to aspire to, and the ability to pursue Lance across the map, to build to a signinficant number iff not regularly dispatched.
- [ ] Use A.I. to regulate optimal game progression and to determine where and when to provide much needed resources and or potion drops to promote forward progress and challenging gameplay while also to prevent glitches and or impassible areas in the game.
- [ ] Blocking consumes Stamina while ducking or dodging does not.
- [ ] Employ ambience zones, queued with atmospheric music, action and lighting.
- [ ] Once Lance has been promoted sufficiently, he can teleport across the field of battle, assess the difficulty of adversaries and delegate what he believes is an approriate amount of war power and mind powerto vanquish a challenge or obstacle.
- [ ] Lance's HP Meter increases as he collects excess hp.
- [ ] Compose game audio and sfx from relaxing sounds so as not to prematurely induce fatigue.
- [ ] Orient the third person camera as a breakaway first-person camera during up-close combat, to add an FPS feel to combat.
- [ ] As an easier game setting, the game's **Combat Carousel** can be **swapped out for** a more basic **Tactic Carousel**, such that the player only needs to schedule, apply, and re-order context appropriate tactics, as they arise, during gameplay. Lance will automagically complete the tactics, in realtime.


## Notes

Maps without **dynamic lighting** or **particle effects** appear mundane. Incorporating consistent and **dynamic decals** (eg. HUD: Maps, Waypoints, Weapons and Inventory), **particle animations** (eg. Lighted loot box interiors; Souls evaporating from felled enemies; Dynamic levers and switches; Character and NPC adornments), and **ambient lighted environments** -- add to the allure of an evironment map.
